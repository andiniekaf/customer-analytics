# Customer Analytics: Predicting customers' propensity to purchase and be retained using an NBD/Pareto Model
This repository aims to build a predictive model to determine customers' worthiness and propensity to purchase based on purchase recency and purchase frequency. The model used in this case is NBD/Pareto Model, which was popularized by Peter Fader of Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania.
